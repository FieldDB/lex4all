Although tools such as Carnegie Mellon University's Sphinx simplify the creation of new acoustic models for recognition, they require large amounts of training data (audio recordings) in the target language. However, for small-vocabulary applications, an existing recognizer for a high-resource language (HRL) can be used to perform recognition in the target language. This requires a pronunciation lexicon mapping the relevant words in the target language into sequences of sounds in the HRL.\r\n\r\nOur goal is to build an easy-to-use application that will allow even naive users to automatically create a pronunciation lexicon for words in any language, using a small number of audio recordings and a pre-existing recognition engine in a HRL such as English. The resulting lexicon can then be used to add small-vocabulary speech recognition functionality to applications in the LRL.\r\n\r\nRead our [project proposal](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/speech4LRL/makelexicons/blob/master/ProjectProposal.html) for more information!\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
