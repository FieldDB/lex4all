click "Save and go back" to return to the main form. 
You'll see the words you've entered, 
and the number of recordings you've selected for each one

<br>
<p>At this point, you might want to change the options using the controls on the lower left.
You can hover over the options to read more about them.
If you're not sure, just leave them as they are.
When you're ready, click "BUILD LEXICON" and choose where to save your lexicon file.
The program will begin to run.</p>

<h2>Evaluating a lexicon</h2>

<div class="center">

<br>
<p>Open the evaluation tool by clicking "Evaluate an existing lexicon" on the start-up page, 
or by answering "Yes" when lex4all asks if you'd like to evaluate the lexicon you just built.</p>
<img src="images/screenshots/Evaluation-Empty.PNG">
<br>

<br>
<p>Click "Select lexicon" and browse your computer for the XML lexicon you want to test.
lex4all will read the lexicon and list the terms it contains.</p>
<img src="images/screenshots/Evaluation-PreFilledWords.PNG">
<br>

<br>
<p>Click "Select audio" to browse for the recording(s) you'd like to use to test each word.
  Remove any terms you don't want to evaluate (you can always replace them later).
</p>
<img src="images/screenshots/Evaluation-Filled.PNG">
<br>

<br>
<p>When you're ready, click "START EVALUATION". 
lex4all will test your lexicon and report the recognition accuracy.
You can save the report and a confusion matrix 
(telling you which terms were recognized as which) for later reference
